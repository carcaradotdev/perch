"""Applies and checks the Apache license header on every source file.

The header is not written down here. It is read out of the LICENSE file at the
repository root, from the boilerplate the Apache License carries in its own
appendix, so the two cannot disagree: change the copyright line in LICENSE and
every source file is stale until this script runs again.

    python3 scripts/license_header.py check    # exits 1 and names the offenders
    python3 scripts/license_header.py apply    # rewrites them in place

Files come from `git ls-files`, so nothing under a build directory is reached and
an untracked scratch file is never rewritten.

The files derived from Ktor open with a comment naming the Ktor source they come
from and JetBrains' copyright. That comment is not a license header, so it is
left where it is and this one goes above it: Apache 2.0 section 4(c) asks that
the attribution notices a derived file arrived with stay in it.
